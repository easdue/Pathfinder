# Pathfinder
Pathfinder is an outdoor activity app centered around gps tracks. The app enables it's users to search for and download gps tracks from GPSies.com or from .gpx files stored in the apps import directory.
A track can then be selected and visually followed on a map using either an online or an offline datasource. A digital compass is also provided that can be used to guide the user from 1 track-point to the next.
The app also allows the user to record new tracks and these can then be uploaded to GPSies.com or shared with other people (send via email, upload to facebook, google drive, ...)

**Note:** This is a work in progress and is far from finished
